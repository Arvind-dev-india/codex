# Recovery Services Implementation Complete

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive Recovery Services (Azure Backup) integration for the Codex project, including both the core functionality and a standalone MCP server. The implementation follows the same patterns as the existing Azure DevOps and Kusto integrations.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Recovery Services API Reference Document
- **File**: `RECOVERY_SERVICES_API_REFERENCE.md`
- Complete documentation of all Azure Recovery Services and Backup REST API endpoints
- Based on the latest Microsoft documentation (API version 2023-04-01)
- Includes curl examples, request/response formats, and best practices
- Covers all major operations: vaults, policies, protection, backup, restore

### 2. Enhanced Client Implementation
- **File**: `codex-rs/core/src/recovery_services/client.rs`
- Updated API versions to use stable 2023-04-01 version
- Added comprehensive client methods for all Recovery Services operations:
  - Vault configuration management
  - Backup job operations (get details, cancel)
  - Recovery point operations (list, get details)
  - Backup triggering with retention options
  - VM restore operations (original/alternate location)
  - Protection management (enable/disable)
  - Policy creation and management
  - Helper methods for Azure VM naming conventions

### 3. Updated Models
- **File**: `codex-rs/core/src/recovery_services/models.rs`
- Added VM workload type support
- Added RecoveryPoint and RecoveryPointProperties models
- Enhanced existing models for better API compatibility

### 4. Comprehensive Tool Implementation

- `recovery_services_clear_auth_cache` - Clear auth cache

### 5. Recovery Services MCP Server
- **Directory**: `codex-rs/recovery-services-server/`
- Standalone MCP server following the same pattern as Azure DevOps and Kusto servers
- Complete with build scripts, test scripts, and documentation
- All 27 tools available through MCP protocol

### 6. Integration with Main Codex Application
- Recovery Services tools are properly registered in the main application
- Function call handler updated to route Recovery Services tool calls
- Authentication integration with existing OAuth system
- Configuration sharing with main application

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Azure VM Backup Support
- Complete VM registration and protection workflow
- Backup policy creation and management
- On-demand backup triggering
- Recovery point management
- VM restore operations (original and alternate location)

### 2. Comprehensive Filtering
- OData filter support for all list operations
- Filter by backup management type, status, operation, date range
- Workload type filtering for policies and items

### 3. Proper Azure Naming Conventions
- Correct container naming: `iaasvmcontainer;iaasvmcontainerv2;{resourceGroup};{vmName}`
- Correct protected item naming: `vm;iaasvmcontainerv2;{resourceGroup};{vmName}`
- Proper resource ID generation

### 4. Error Handling and Logging
- Comprehensive error handling throughout
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Proper error responses in JSON format

### 5. Authentication Integration
- Uses existing OAuth authentication system
- Separate auth cache for Recovery Services
- Token sharing with other Azure services

## Configuration

The implementation supports flexible configuration:

```toml
[recovery_services]
enabled = true
subscription_id = "your-subscription-id"
resource_group = "your-resource-group"
vault_name = "your-vault-name"

# Multiple vaults support
[recovery_services.vaults.production]
name = "prod-vault"
subscription_id = "prod-subscription-id"
resource_group = "prod-rg"
description = "Production backup vault"
is_default = true
```

## Usage Examples

### Using with Main Codex Application
```bash
codex "list recovery services vaults"
codex "register VM myvm in resource group myrg for backup"
codex "enable protection for VM myvm with policy daily-backup"
codex "trigger backup for VM myvm"
codex "list recovery points for VM myvm"
```

### Using with MCP Server
```bash
# Build the server
cd codex-rs/recovery-services-server
./build.sh

# Test the server
./test-server.sh

# Use with Claude Desktop or other MCP clients
```

## Build Status
âœ… **All components build successfully** - The implementation compiles without errors and is ready for use.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Test the implementation with real Azure Recovery Services vaults
2. **Documentation**: Add more usage examples and troubleshooting guides
3. **Enhancement**: Add support for more workload types (SQL, SAP HANA)
4. **Integration**: Test with various MCP clients
